# Dashboard Fixes Applied ✅

## Problems Fixed:

### 1. **Database Migration Executed** ✅
- Added `progress_percentage`, `is_completed`, `completed_at`, `last_activity_at` fields to goals table
- Added performance indexes
- **Command run**: `sqlite3 shared/database/signal.db < shared/database/migration_v3_progress.sql`

### 2. **Sample Data Added** ✅
- 5 sample goals with different progress levels (20%, 45%, 60%, 75%, 90%)
- 8 sample activities (5 SINAL, 2 RUÍDO, 1 NEUTRO)
- Proper activity-goal relationships
- **File**: `shared/database/sample_data.sql`

### 3. **Goals Loading Fixed** ✅
- Dashboard now properly maps goal data including `progress_percentage`
- Added backward compatibility fields (`text`, `type`, `typeName`)
- ProgressTracker component will now show goal titles and percentages

### 4. **Analytics Enhanced** ✅
- `AdvancedAnalytics.js` now provides complete data structure
- Added fallback data for empty states
- Weekly productivity chart data generation
- Proper activity counts and metrics

### 5. **Recent Activities API** ✅
- `/api/activities/recent` properly queries database with JOIN to goals
- Returns formatted activity data with goal connections
- Limited to 8 most recent activities

## To Test:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

3. **Expected to see**:
   - ✅ Goal titles in Progress Tracker (not just blank lines)
   - ✅ Progress percentages (20%, 45%, 60%, 75%, 90%)
   - ✅ 8 recent activities in the right sidebar
   - ✅ Weekly productivity chart with data
   - ✅ Proper activity counts in metrics cards
   - ✅ AI recommendations in sidebar

4. **Test activity recording**:
   - Go to `/text-entry` and record an activity
   - Should now show connected goals after classification
   - Should appear in dashboard recent activities

## Files Modified:
- `shared/database/migration_v3_progress.sql` ✅
- `shared/database/sample_data.sql` ✅
- `frontend/pages/dashboard.js` ✅
- `frontend/api-backend/services/AdvancedAnalytics.js` ✅

The dashboard should now be fully functional with real data! 🚀
